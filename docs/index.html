            <h1>Refugee flows across history</h1>
            <h2>Data Visualization Project</h2>
            <p>This visualization is meant to provide insights about refugee flows and how
                events such as wars and conflicts influence the migration of populations. </p>
            <h2>Data</h2>
            <p> Out of the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/unitednations/refugee-data/data">UNHCR Refugee Data</a>, we
                use
                the
                file time_series.csv which is organised in the following way:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Year</li>
                <li>Country / territory of asylum / residence</li>
                <p>Indicates the destination of the refugees</p>
                <li>Origin</li>
                <p>Indicates the origin of the refugees</p>
                <li>Population type</li>
                <p>This column was irrelevant as its field was always 'Refugees'</p>
                <li>Value</li>
                <p>The number of refugees that year</p>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
            <h2>Features of the visualization</h2>

            <h3>Interactive map</h3>
            <img src="imgs/map.png">
            <p>
                The map contains mainly two visual representation of the data: The chloropleth and the flows.
                The chloropleth represents the delta of inflows and outflows. If for a given year a country had more
                incoming
                refugees than outgoing its color will be in the blue tones, whereas in the other case its color will be
                in
                the
                red tones. The flows give a feeling about the number of refugees moving out/in a selected country; a
                country
                can
                be selected by a simple click. For the flows, we chose the tradeoff of having a better feeling of the
                data
                over a linear mapping from the data to the number of points in the flow. Each time you select a country,
                you
                will
                also see numbers on the map representing in red: the number of refugees from the selected country that
                went
                to the
                country where the number is displayed and in blue the number of refugee that came from the country where
                the
                number
                is displayed to the selected country.The map also gives two more classical features: a click & drag as
                well
                as a zoom feature
            </p>

            <h3>Timeline</h3>
            <img src="imgs/timeline.png">
            <p>
                The timeline is the main year-selection tool. You can either click the timeline on the year you with to
                visualize or click & drag the cursor to either see the evolution on the map or choose a year more freely
            </p>

            <h3>Graph</h3>
            <img src="imgs/graph.png">
            <p>
                The graph provides more accurate information about the data in comparison with the map. The bars
                represent
                the inflows (blue) and outlfows (red) for the selected country on the map. The line shows the delta of
                flows.
                The current year is highlighted and by sliding over the bars, you can find the exact values from the
                data.
                The graph with evolve as you select different countries or different years.
            </p>
            <h3>Buttons</h3>
            <img src="imgs/buttons.png">
            <p>
                Near the year display, you will find three small buttons. The two surrounding the year allow you to
                increase or decrease current year by 1. The play button, once clicked, starts an automatic mode where
                the
                current year increase periodically; changing the map and the graph display in the process.
            </p>
            <h3>List of events</h3>
            <img src="imgs/events.png">
            <p>
                The list of events gives a non-exhaustive list of events correlated with the movements of refugees for
                the
                current year. If you click an event, the map, the graph and the images will change its display to show
                the
                flows
                for the event-related country.
            </p>
            <h3>Contextual images</h3>
            <img src="imgs/context_img.png">
            <p>
                Only accessible from the list of events, the contextual images are event-related. The navigation between
                images can be done through clicking in order to zoom on a specific image.
            </p>

            <h2>The Syria refugee crisis</h2>
            <p>
                Now let's use our new tools to get an insight of the refugee flows during the Syrian crisis. Start by
                moving
                the cursor to 2011. In the least of events, you can see that the event 'Syrian civil war' appeared. If
                you
                click
                on it, you can see on the map that the flows displayed are now the flows from and to Syria. The graph
                also
                changed
                and we see that the increase in outgoing refugees increases drastically after 2011. Now we can select
                2012
                to see
                the evolution of the flow. We see that the flow has already increased a lot. In 2012, the main
                destination
                of
                refugees is Turkey, with 317'239 refugees in 2012 as well as Jordan with 239'289 refugees.
