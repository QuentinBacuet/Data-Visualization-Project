            <h1>Refugee flows across history</h1>
            <h2>Data Visualization Project</h2>
            <p>This visualization will provide you with insights about refugee flows and how
                events such as wars and conflicts influence the migration of populations. </p>
            <h2>Data</h2>
            <p> The dataset used to produce this visualization was gathered by the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/">UNHCR</a> and is made available <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/unitednations/refugee-data/data">here</a>.
			
            <h2>Features of the visualization</h2>

            <h3>Interactive map</h3>
            <img src="imgs/map.png">
            <p>
                The map contains mainly two visual representations of the data: The choropleth layer and the dynamic flows.
                The choropleth layer illustrates the net difference between inflows and outflows of refugees. 
				This difference is scaled by the population of the host country.
				The flows give a feeling about the number of refugees moving in and out of a selected country; the bigger the flow, the
				higher the number of refugees.
				A
                country
                can
                be selected by a simple click. 
				You
                will
                also see numbers on the map representing in red: the number of refugees from the selected country that
                went
                to the
                country where the number is displayed and in blue the number of refugee that came from the country where
                the
                number
                is displayed to the selected country.
            </p>

            <h3>Timeline</h3>
            <img src="imgs/timeline.png">
            <p>
                The timeline is the main year-selection tool. You can either click the timeline on the year you wish to
                visualize or click & drag the cursor.
            </p>

            <h3>Country Flow Graph</h3>
            <img src="imgs/graph.png">
            <p>
                The graph provides more accurate information about the data in comparison to the map. The bars
                represent
                the inflows (blue) and outlfows (red) for the selected country. The line shows the net difference.
                The current year is highlighted and by sliding over the bars, you will find the exact values from the
                data.
                The graph with evolve as you select different countries or different years.
            </p>
            <h3>Buttons</h3>
            <img src="imgs/buttons.png">
            <p>
                Near the year display, you will find three small buttons. The two surrounding the current year allow you to
                increase or decrease it by 1. The play button, once clicked, starts an automatic mode where
                the
                current year increase periodically; updating the map and the graph in the process.
            </p>
            <h3>List of events</h3>
            <img src="imgs/events.png">
            <p>
                The list of events gives a non-exhaustive list of events correlated with the movements of refugees for
                the
                current year. If you click on an event, the map, the graph and the images will change to show
                the
                flows
                for the event-related country. Double-click on it and you will be brought to the appropriate Wikipedia page.
            </p>
            <h3>Contextual images</h3>
            <img src="imgs/context_img.png">
            <p>
                Only accessible from the list of events, the contextual images are event-related. Clicking on an image will change its size
				relative to the others.
            </p>

            <h2>The Syria refugee crisis</h2>
            <p>
                Now let's use our new tools to get an insight of the gravity of the Syrian civil war.
                When you launch the visualization, you should have a screen like this:
            </p>
                <img src="imgs/syria_1.png">
            <p>
                Start by moving the cursor on the timeline at the start of the conflicts in Syria, in 2011. As stated above,
                you can do this either by clicking on 2011, or clicking anywhere on the timeline and then dragging the cursor
                to 2011.
            </p>
                <img src="imgs/syria_2.png">
            <p>
                In the list of events, you can see that the event 'Syrian civil war' appeared.
            </p>
                <img src="imgs/syria_3.png">
            <p>
                If
                you
                click
                on it, you can see on the map that the flows displayed are now the flows from and to Syria.
                The graph also
                changed.
            </p>
                <img src="imgs/syria_4.png">
            <p>
                We see that the number of outgoing refugees increases drastically after 2011. Now we can select
                2012
                to see
                the evolution of the flow. We see that the flow has already increased a lot. In 2012, the main
                destination
                of refugees is Turkey, with 317'239 refugees in 2012 as well as Jordan with 239'289 refugees.
