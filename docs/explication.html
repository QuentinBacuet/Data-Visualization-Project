<h1>Goals</h1>
<p>The visualization is meant to provide an insight into the world refugees data and a way to observe how
events such as wars and conflicts influence the movements of refugees. </p>
<h1>Data</h1>
<p> Out of the <a href ="https://www.kaggle.com/unitednations/refugee-data/data">UNHCR Refugee Data</a>, we use the
    file time_series.csv which is organised in the following way:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Year</li>
    <li>Country / territory of asylum / residence</li>
    <p>Indicates the destination of the refugees</p>
    <li>Origin</li>
    <p>Indicates the origin of the refugees</p>
    <li>Population type</li>
    <p>This column was irrelevant as its field was always 'Refugees'</p>
    <li>Value</li>
    <p>The number of refugees that year</p>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h1>Features of the visualization</h1>

    <h2>Interactive map</h2>
    <p>
        The map contains mainly two visual representation of the data: The chloropleth and the flows.
    The chloropleth represents the delta of inflows and outflows. If for a given year a country had more incoming
    refugees than outgoing its color will be in the blue tones, whereas in the other case its color will be in the
    red tones. The flows give a feeling about the number of refugees moving out/in a selected country; a country can
    be selected by a simple click. For the flows, we chose the tradeoff of having a better feeling of the data
    over a linear mapping from the data to the number of points in the flow. Each time you select a country, you will
    also see numbers on the map representing in red: the number of refugees from the selected country that went to the
    country where the number is displayed and in blue the number of refugee that came from the country where the number
    is displayed to the selected country.The map also gives two more classical features: a click & drag as well as a zoom feature
    </p>

    <h2>Timeline</h2>
    <p>
        The timeline is the main year-selection tool. You can either click the timeline on the year you with to
        visualize or click & drag the cursor to either see the evolution on the map or choose a year more freely
    </p>

    <h2>Graph</h2>
    <p>
        The graph provides more accurate information about the data in comparison with the map. The bars represent
        the inflows (blue) and outlfows (red) for the selected country on the map. The line shows the delta of flows.
        The current year is highlighted and by sliding over the bars, you can find the exact values from the data.
        The graph with evolve as you select different countries or different years.
    </p>
    <h2>Buttons</h2>
    <p>
        Near the year display, you will find three small buttons. The two surrounding the year allow you to
        increase or decrease current year by 1. The play button, once clicked, starts an automatic mode where the
        current year increase periodically; changing the map and the graph display in the process.
    </p>
    <h2>List of events</h2>
    <p>
        The list of events gives a non-exhaustive list of events correlated with the movements of refugees for the
        current year. If you click an event, the map, the graph and the images will change its display to show the flows
        for the event-related country.
    </p>
    <h2>Contextual images</h2>
    <p>
        Only accessible from the list of events, the contextual images are event-related. The navigation between
        images can be done through clicking in order to zoom on a specific image.
    </p>

<h1>The Syria refugee crisis</h1>
<p>
    Now let's use our new tools to get an insight of the refugee flows during the Syrian crisis. Start by moving
    the cursor to 2011. In the least of events, you can see that the event 'Syrian civil war' appeared. If you click
    on it, you can see on the map that the flows displayed are now the flows from and to Syria. The graph also changed
    and we see that the increase in outgoing refugees increases drastically after 2011. Now we can select 2012 to see
    the evolution of the flow. We see that the flow has already increased a lot. In 2012, the main destination of
    refugees is Turkey, with 317'239 refugees in 2012 as well as Jordan with 239'289 refugees.
